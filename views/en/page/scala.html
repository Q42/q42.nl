          Scala is an object-functional programming language for general software applications. Scala has full support for functional programming and a very strong static type system. This allows programs written in Scala to be very concise and thus smaller in size than other general-purpose programming languages.Java libraries may be used directly in Scala code and vice versa. This means you can use a lot of the JVM libraries published in the past decade! But it doesn't mean we use new libraries like; Akka, Scalaz, Play!, etc on the contrary!

          We've done a few projects in Scala and we are quite happy with it. The code is more concise, contains less bugs and is better maintainable! There are also some very exciting things in the works (but some of them are quite production-ready)! Like Scala.JS, Akka-Stream, Akka-Http, Play! 3.0, etc.
