          <p>Musicians always list which instruments they use on their website. Not that we're suggesting we might be rockstars (not out loud at least), but we like to believe that for some people (potential Q'ers, potential clients, competitors, ...) it may be of interest to see which tools we use at Q42. Amongst others. Because this list is hardly complete. And we don't have any qualms with discovering new things.</p>

          <h2>Yes, but Q, tell me, which technology do you use?</h2>
          <p>All sorts. Whatever works for the job at hand. That's often ASP.NET, C#, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3. And often <a href="/swift">Swift</a> or Objective-C. Also often Google App Engine, Play, Java. But also Haskell, <a href="http://q42.com/scala">Scala</a>, Python, <a href="http://q42.com/meteor">Meteor</a> (used to build this site!), Ruby on Rails, Coffeescript, MSSQL, Angular, MySQL, NoSQL, Autofac, Azure, Elastic Search, jQuery, MongoDB, WebGL and more. Like I said: all sorts.</p>

            <p>"I'm working on index.html, everyone keep off!" and "I'll email you a new zip shortly!" have been not done for years. For a while things went alright with SVN, but now Github is the hip, modern thing. So we use that. Take a look: <a href="http://github.com/q42">Q42 on Github</a>, it's even a nice excuse to keep all of our open-source stuff in one place!</p>
            <p>Oh yeah, and you need to use SourceTree if you want a nice Git UI. It's really good.</p>

            <p>You have to type your code into something and luckily, these days there are plenty of nice editors to choose from. <a href="/products">Our own Handcraft</a> for the quick HTML prototype/mini-site, XCode for all our iOS projects, Visual Studio if we need .NET, and Sublime Text for everything else.</p>
            <p>Except if it's Java. Then you have to use Eclipse again. And no one wants that. So we just use IntelliJ!</p>

            <h2>Slack</h2>
            <h3>IRC for the 21st century</h3>
            <p>Now that we have three locations, it's really time for us to keep in touch even when we're not in the same room. That's why we use Slack, by the original creators of Flickr. And it's <em>amazing</em>. With a supersmart adaptive pricing system, so you're never paying too much.</p>

            <h3>Keep getting to know each other better</h3>
            <p>KYC is another tool we started using because we're in The Hague, Amsterdam and Mountain View now. Every week it sends out 3 emails to the whole team and all answers are collated and sent to everyone. This way you keep up to date with what everyone's up to. But also what everyone thinks of various things at Q42, or what they're up to in their private lives. And that really helps when you don't see each other as often as you used to.</p>

            <h2>Intercom</h2>
            <h3>The best way to do customer support</h3>
            <p>Intercom is actually pretty revolutionary, because now you don't have to write any code to keep in touch with your customers. Now you just add a widget to your page, send the right data over the wire, and you can chat seamlessly with users, send emails, and ask questions. All from the Intercom interface. We use it in Handcraft.</p>

            <h3>Because you can't do without continuous integration</h3>
            <p>Mark is our Teamcity King and you basically can't launch a project without first having it in Teamcity. Or Appveyor or Travis, that's okay too. And then you get your face plastered all over the screen in the garden when you break the build. Part of the deal.</p>

            <h2>The Qure</h2>
            <h3>Our homegrown, nice and simple time tracking and planning system</h3>
            <p>Since we like being paid for all the awesome work we do, we have to track our hours and hold ourselves accountable. But most tools for this kind of thing aren't very fun to use. So we built our own. It's called The Qure and it has a very important mission: making sure a programmer spends minimal time filling in her hours.</p>

            <p>Our bug trackers and whiteboard tools. Before Trello was released we were still searching for the tool that would truly make us happy. But Trello is pretty much it. Now to get rid of the other two! ;-)</p>
            <p>By the way, did you know we built a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scrum-for-trello/jdbcdblgjdpmfninkoogcfpnkjmndgje?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon">Scrum extension for Trello</a>? Super useful.</p>

            <p>Nearly forgot Dropbox! And oh how useful it is. Spaceventure was made almost entirely with Dropbox. When we work together with Fabrique we have a shared folder of Sketch files. Ask Martin about Dropbox, he's their biggest fan.</p>

            <h2>Basecamp</h2>
            <h3>Undefeated at project communication</h3>
            <p>We've used Basecamp for a while, but especially now that the new version is out we've noticed that we've started using it again. Useful to organise a Flyby conference, or a Stephen Anderson workshop. Less useful for software development, but that's okay since we have Trello now.</p>
