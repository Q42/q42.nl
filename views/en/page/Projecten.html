        <p>Honestly, we love the internet. Web apps, mobile apps,
          internet of things. Websites. Online stuff. There's something about
          the internet and how it enables whole classes of tools that wouldn't
          be possible without it. We also love a good challenge, especially
          one that involves pushing the limits of what's possible.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, though, what we really want to do is make people happy
          by crafting great software that isn't just useful, it's also friendly.
